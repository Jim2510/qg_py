# Python Quiz Game

Welcome to the Python Quiz Game! This is a simple program made by me, Gianmarco, to help you study Python while tracking your score to improve your skills.

## How to Play

1. Run the script `python_quiz_game.py` in your Python environment.
2. The game will start by asking if you are ready to play.
3. Answer "y" to start the quiz or "n" to quit.
4. Choose your difficulty level:
   - 1 for Easy
   - 2 for Medium
   - 3 for Hard
5. Answer each question by typing your response and pressing Enter.
6. The game will tell you if your answer is correct or wrong and keep track of your score.
7. At the end of the quiz, your final score will be displayed.

## Example Questions

Here are a few examples of the questions you will encounter in the game:

- **Easy Level**:

  - What is the output of `print(2 ** 3)`?
  - Which of the following is a Python data type?
    1. list
    2. array
    3. function

- **Medium Level**:

  - What is the output of `print('Python'[1])`?
  - How do you access the last element of a list `lst`?

- **Hard Level**:
  - What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in a Python class?
  - What is the output of `print([i for i in range(5)])`?
